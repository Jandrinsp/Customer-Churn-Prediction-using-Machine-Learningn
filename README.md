# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learningn

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn using historical customer data.  
It involves data exploration, data preprocessing, and training of a supervised classification model to identify customers likely to leave the company.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer-related information such as:
- Age
- Income
- Tenure (time as a customer)
- Service usage metrics
- Customer support interactions
- And other relevant features

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing and model training.
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Goals
- Analyze the key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Build and optimize a predictive model for churn detection.
- Evaluate the model using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jandrinsp/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
